Treating black rot on apple trees starts with sanitation. 
Because fungal spores overwinter on fallen leaves, mummifed 
fruits, dead bark and cankers, it’s important to keep all 
the fallen debris and dead fruit cleaned up and away from the tree.
During the winter, check for red cankers and remove them by cutting 
them out or pruning away the afected limbs at least six inches beyond 
the wound. Destroy all infected tissue immediately and keep a watchful 
eye out for new signs of infection Once black rot disease is under 
control in your tree and you’re again harvesting healthy fruits, make 
sure to remove any injured or insect-invaded fruits to avoid re-infection.
Although general purpose fungicides, like copper-based sprays and lime 
sulfur, can be used to control black rot, nothing will improve apple 
black rot like removing all sources of spores.
