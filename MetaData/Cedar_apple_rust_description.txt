Cedar apple rust, or CAR, is a peculiar fungal disease 
that affects both apple trees and red cedar.Spores from 
one tree only affect the other and vice versa.For instance,
the spores on apple trees only infect cedar while the spores
found on cedar trees only affect apples.This disease can 
quickly defoliate apple trees and cause blemishes on the 
fruit.
