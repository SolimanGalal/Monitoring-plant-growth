Black rot is a disease of apples that infects fruit,
leaves and bark caused by the fungus Botryosphaeria obtusa.
It can also jump to healthy tissue on pear or quince trees,
but is typically a secondary fungus of weak or dead tissues
in other plants. Begin checking your apple trees for signs 
of infection about a week after the petals fall from your 
apple blossoms.
