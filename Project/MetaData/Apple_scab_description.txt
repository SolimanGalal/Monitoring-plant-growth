Apple scab fungus infects developing apples early in 
the season but may not become visible on fruits until
they’ve begun to expand. Instead, apple scab rust appears 
on the undersides of the leaves of the blossom clusters.
These fuzzy, roughly circular, brown to dark olive green
lesions may cause leaves to distort or crinkle. Scabs can 
be small and few.
